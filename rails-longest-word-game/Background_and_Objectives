Background & Objectives
Using a package of the standard library
Working with CSV file input
In order to read a CSV file and extract its data you can use the csv package that comes with ruby standard library. The CSV given as an example in lib/movies.csv has been taken from IMDB.

Ruby Standard Library
The Ruby standard library includes all the convenient packages that come with your ruby installation. For instance the date package, if included in your ruby program, enables you to manipulate dates easily. A package is loaded at the beginning of your ruby file with:

require "date"
There are loads more useful ones in there too, so make sure you have a read!

Specs
implement #most_successful that returns the number of movies published prior to a given year, with associated earnings.
constraint: the returned list should be an array of movies. Each movie should be represented by a hash with keys name, year and earnings. Ex: { name: "Avatar", year: 2009, earnings: 760505847 }
Further suggestions & resources
Make sure you specify the good encoding options for reading the CSV. Remember, some titles are given in French with special characters ðŸ˜‰
